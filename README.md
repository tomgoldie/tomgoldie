<p>I’m @tomgoldie
<p>I’m interested in building several projects, but have dreams bigger than my coding skills:
<ul>
<li>A tool to build term hierarchies useful for educators</li>
<li>A community-powered website ⁸</li>
<li>A website to facilitate paying/donating small amounts easily over the internet</li>
<li>A tool to help counties crowdsource election security, to include
<ul>
<li>Signature verification</li>
<li>Voter verification</li>
<li>Vote counting</li>
<li>Providing transparency and proof of results<>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>I’m currently learning how GitHub works, and how I might use it to make some of my dreams realities.
<p>I’m looking to collaborate on any of these projects others might be interested in working on.
