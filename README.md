- 👋 Hi, I’m @tomgoldie
- 👀 I’m interested in building several projects, but have dreams bigger than my coding skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how GitHub works, and how I might use it to make some of my dreams realities.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of these projects others might be interested in working on.
- 📫 How to reach me: tomgoldie@yahoo.com
